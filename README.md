Python scripts for automatic key detection in EDM

This repository provides scripts for key detection and its evaluation.
It also contains a program to automatically extract key-profiles from a corpus.
They are based on a fork of MTG's Music Information Retrieval Library "Essentia"
which can be downloaded from the following link:

https://github.com/angelfaraldo/essentia

You can follow instructions of that page, or visit the home page of
Essentia (http://essentia.upf.edu/) for further information about the
library and how to build it and install it. Detailed instructions and
dependencies here:
