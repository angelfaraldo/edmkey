## edmkey - AES 2017

This repository contains python scripts to replicate the key detection experiments reported in the following paper:

**Faraldo, Jord√†, S., & Herrera, P.** (2017). A Multi-Profile Method for Key Estimation in EDM. *Audio Engineering Society Conference on Semantic Audio*. Erlangen, Germany.

### Installation

The method and code are programmed in python using *Numpy* and *Essentia*, a library for Music Information Retrieval written in C++. Download *Numpy* directly via pip:

***pip install numpy***

Since *Essentia* is an ongrowing project, we have included a frozen version with this repository. 
Access the essentia folder and follow the instructions in essentia's website to download dependencies, build and compile:
