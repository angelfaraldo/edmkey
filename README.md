**Faraldo, Jord√†, S., & Herrera, P.** (2017). A Multi-Profile Method for Key Estimation in EDM. *Audio Engineering Society Conference on Semantic Audio. Erlangen, Germany.

### Installation

The method and code are programmed in *Essentia*, a library for Music Information Retrieval written in C++.
Since essentia is an ongrowing project, we have included a frozen version with this repository. 
Access the essentia folder and follow the instructions in essentia's website to build and compile:
